# noteTakerDB

## Description

This Full stack application is a program that focuses on the backend.
In this project my goal was to set up, connect and use API routes. I made sure that the front end components were making calls to the backend, that I had created those routes and that they were properly responding. I also made sure that this pap was able to connect to heroku and deployed it from there
